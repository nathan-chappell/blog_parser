context             | There are several approaches for integrating custom
                    fonts to standards-compliant web pages - some of them
                    use custom scripts (Cufon, sIFR, FLIR), and others use
                    pure-CSS solutions, like @font-face. All of these
                    technologies have valid arguments both for and against
                    their use, but probably the most flexible and safest,
                    and in general the best method for using various non
                    -system fonts on your web site is @font-face.
