  answer: font-face
  context: There are several approaches for integrating custom fonts to standards-compliant
    web pages - some of them use custom scripts (Cufon, sIFR, FLIR), and others use
    pure-CSS solutions, like @font-face. All of these technologies have valid arguments
    both for and against their use, but probably the most flexible and safest, and
    in general the best method for using various non-system fonts on your web site
    is @font-face.

  answer: Microsoft recently introduced Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support
  context: Microsoft recently introduced Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support
    for Azure blobs, queues and tables.  This means you can now access Azure resources
    using AJAX-only calls from any domain which is quite handy. Imagine having a website
    hosted on your own server and allowing your users to upload large files to Azure
    Storage. Previously, you would need to upload and siphon all the data through
    your server and you would have to use Azure Storage SDK to do it. This means that
    processing time and bandwidth of your server are being wasted just for relaying
    data to its real destination. The good news is - you can now upload files to Azure
    Storage directly from the browser, using only client-side code and the Azure REST
    API, and without wasting additional server resources.

  answer: your upload PUT requests against Azure will be rejected
  context: To upload files through an SAS URI, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing needs
    to be enabled over at Azure for your particular domain. If you don't enable CORS,
    your upload PUT requests against Azure will be rejected. You can read a bit more
    about managing Azure CORS rules in my previous post. Normally you would have to
    set the rules up through your source-code, but since this is a one-time set-up,
    it makes no sense to keep this code in your project. That's why we made a simple
    web app for managing Azure CORS rules which you can download over at github. It

  time: 0.14777

- !Result
  answer: around 2000
  context: Slow rendering will make it longer for the data to actually show up in
    the browser (on initial and every subsequent render) and huge amount of watchers
    will make your website laggy and less responsive in general once everything is
    rendered. Keep in mind that recommended amount of watchers per page is around
    2000. So if your list is not that long but 'only' has a lot of watchers, you might
    be able to work around the problem using bindonce which will significantly decrease
    the number of watchers on your page. If your list however is quite long, rendering
    it will take some time.

  answer: real-time communication
  context: Even if you're using SocketIO, chances are you don't really need all your
    communication between the client and the server to go through sockets. For all
    the parts of your application that require real-time communication SocketIO will
    be perfect but for everything else you might be better off using standard REST
    API calls. Why? Without going into 'speed' and 'ease of implementation' pros and
    cons (there's plenty of that lying around the Internet) I see a few reasons why
    one might want to use both in the same application. REST is still a bit more 'standard'
    way to exchange data and if there is no real need to use websockets everywhere,
    your team might be a bit more comfortable using REST since it's what they've been
    using 'ever since'. Other than that, you might be in the middle of a project that
    previously used REST for everything and now the need arose to develop a component
    which requires real-time communication. Of course, you won't be rewriting all
    your code to SocketIO because there are more important things to dedicate your
    time to. Or you might simply believe SocketIO should be in charge of everything
    real-time and REST should be used to handle everything else - which is also perfectly
    fine. Either way, you'll most probably get into situation where you'll want to
    share session data between the two.

  answer: too cold and generic
  context: We have done a lot of desk research and discussions on the logical evolutionary
    steps for our visual identity. The result was clear -- we wanted to keep the core
    idea of a 'pixel' that was a cornerstone of our old visual identity. It is a good
    representation of the digital world, but we felt it did not represent our brand
    good enough on its own - however, we've decided to use it as a core element of
    the new design. The pixel, along with the blue color scheme was way too cold and
    generic, so that had to go away. To achieve a warmer, more human approach we changed
    our brand colors to vibrant red and elegant black.

  answer: it cannot scale out horizontally
  context: While we've used SQL Server in most of our previous implementations, after
    doing some preliminary tests, PostgreSQL proved to be a very capable relational
    database. After all, it has millions of implementations over its 30-year history.
    It is still being kept very relevant in the big data era by adding support for
    new data types, such as JSON - a feature that is essential for implementing dynamic
    types and similar functionality in Baasic and similar solutions. The capability
    to handle schema-less data simultaneously with traditional relational data is
    a big plus for us. However, as most of traditional RDBMSes designed to power transactional
    workloads, it cannot scale out horizontally (at least without specialized add-ons).
    When resources become thin, you would buy a bigger server, instead of scaling
    the load out to multiple smaller machines. While scale-out approach is becoming
    increasingly popular these days (mostly in various NoSQL incarnations), I would
    still argue that scaling up is a viable solution for a large class of problems.
    If you need to scale on a Google scale, scale out is the right way to go. However,
    we are not Google, and neither are most of the web sites and applications.

  answer: Shoot The Other Node In The Head
  context: In our case, we needed full support for failover - in a two DB servers
    scenarios, if the primary server fails then the standby server should begin failover
    procedures. On a side note, this is probably the right time to introduce concepts
    of cold, warm and hot standby nodes. So, when the old primary server restarts,
    we must have a mechanism for informing the old primary that it is no longer the
    primary. This is known as STONITH (Shoot The Other Node In The Head), and is essential
    to avoid situations where both systems think they are the primary, which is a
    sure recipe for disaster, split-brain scenario and, ultimately, data loss. On
    the other hand, attempts to use PostgreSQL in multi-master shared storage configurations
    result in extremely severe data corruption. To make things more interesting, PostgreSQL
    does not provide the tools required to identify a failure on the primary and notify
    the standby database server out of the box. We did some research and tested a
    lot of tools for solving this problem, and while some users are perfectly happy
    with their choices, we were somewhat reluctant. In addition to that, running Windows
    version of PostgreSQL in a production environment is really not the best idea
    - and we already had a set of Windows Server 2012 R2 Servers with Hyper-V role

  answer: a group of servers
  context: A failover cluster is a group of servers that work together to maintain
    high availability of applications and services (these are known as roles). If
    one of the servers (or nodes) fails, another node in the cluster can take over
    its workload without any downtime. In addition, the clustered roles are monitored
    to verify that they are working properly. If they are not working, they are restarted
    or moved to another node. Failover clusters also provide Cluster Shared Volume
    (CSV, more on that later) functionality that provides a consistent, distributed
    namespace that clustered roles can use to access shared storage from all nodes.
    Using this technology, you can scale up to 64 physical nodes and to 8,000 virtual

  answer: an abstract representation of multiple routers
  context: 'Just to briefly mention the rest of the network infrastructure (firewalls,
    routers and load balancers) in front of these servers. Everything is set up in
    a redundant fashion. Therefore, firewalls/routers are using Virtual Router Redundancy
    Protocol (VRRP) that introduce a concept of virtual routers, which are an abstract
    representation of multiple routers - master and backup - acting as a group. When
    an active routers fails, a backup router is automatically selected to replace
    it. In a similar fashion, we are using multiple HAProxy load balancers, along
    with multiple A DNS records for our service employing round robin technique. There
    are multiple approaches for achieving the full redundancy and avoiding single
    point of failure in this type of environment: for example, Stackoverflow apparently
    uses keepalived to ensure high availability; heartbeat is also an alternative.
    We opted for an alternative approach that combines DNS load balancing - which
    achieves a fairly rough balance of traffic between multiple load balancers and
    enable failover when one of load balancer dies - and using load balancers to do
    their job on a more granular level. ''DNS Load Balancing and Using Multiple Load

  answer: at least two separate NICs
  context: 'Is is always a good idea to use at least two separate NICs in failover
    clustering scenarios: the public interface is configured with the IP address that
    will be used to communicate with clients over the network, while the private interface
    is used for communicating with other cluster nodes (''heartbeat''). We will use
    an additional NIC for backup purposes - although this is not absolutely necessary,
    it will offload the traffic caused by regular backup tasks from the public interface.
    This leaves us with one free NIC, and we''ve decided to team two NICs on a main
    public interface. NIC team is basically a collection of network interfaces that
    work together as one, providing bandwidth aggregation and redundancy. It is easy
    to team NICs in Windows Server 2012, so I will not provide a step by step instructions

  answer: Failover clustering is available in both Standard and Datacenter editions
  context: Failover clustering is available in both Standard and Datacenter editions
    of Windows Server 2012 R2. Generally speaking, clustering involves using two or
    more physical servers to create one 'logical' server that exposes some functionality
    to users or applications. The members of the cluster (called nodes) are able to
    monitor each other and, if one of them goes down, its functionality 'fails over'
    to other nodes without causing any disruption of service to the users.

    BarFactory (or in a real life situation, a really complex chain of objects) needs
    to be injected by the parent scoping type (Foo or Goo or Moo) because that's under
    Ninject's control and that's the only way it can pass the contextual parent scope
    information down to the injection chain. As soon as one moves away from the NamedScope
    extension way of doing things, the biggest challenge in accomplishing Ninject
    to be aware of a custom scope is not wiring it in the bindings, but actually propagating

  answer: (AWS) provides a platform that is well suited for building fault-tolerant

  context: Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a platform that is well suited for building
    fault-tolerant software. Similar services are offered by other cloud providers,
    and most of them provide the infrastructure needed for building fault-tolerant
    systems that operate with a minimal amount of human interaction and up-front financial
    investment. We have chosen AWS because of its sheer size, popularity, and price
    structure. More importantly, we were looking to avoid complicated and time-consuming
    administrative tasks such as database installation and upgrades; storage management;
    replication for high availability and read throughput; and backups for disaster
    recovery. Over the past few years, PostgreSQL has become the preferred open source
    relational database for many developers, and we are using it in most of our new
    applications. Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) makes it easy to set up,
    operate, and scale PostgreSQL databases in the cloud, and provides support for
    Amazon Aurora, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle and SQL Server too. It is an ideal choice

    the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone. Each AZ has its
    own physically distinct infrastructure. In the case of an infrastructure failure,
    Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby, so that you can resume
    database operations as soon as the failover is complete - in our initial tests,
    this takes less than a minute. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains

    Observables! Now, observables are great. They are a part of Reactive Extensions.
    If you haven't seen them yet, it's time to learn more. But what's the difference
    between promises and observables? Observables are lazy - meaning you have to subscribe
    to them in order to trigger their behavior and you can also cancel your request

    As you can guess, elements such as video and audio can not be reproduced on paper.
    The best thing you can do here is to hide them, or show just the title. When using
    different kinds of slideshows, showing just one slide can do the trick. If you
    click here on paper you will not be redirected to a new paper, so showing a full
    URL is a way to go. Another useful feature is a possibility to switch between

  answer: working with data sent by the browser
  context: Model binding is a mechanism ASP.NET MVC uses to create parameter objects
    defined in controller action methods. The parameters can be of any type, from
    simple to complex ones. It simplifies working with data sent by the browser because
    data is automatically assigned to the specified model. Without this mechanism,
    developers would need to manually assign values to model properties, which would
    result in writing almost the same code in every action method.

  answer: the double-submit cookie defense pattern
  context: AngularJS also provides protection from certain types of attacks if the
    server is compatible and properly configured. Firstly, for those who do not know,
    cookies are domain-specific data that persists when making requests. If cookies
    are being used for authorization between the server and the client, AngularJS
    provides protection from XSRF attacks by using the double-submit cookie defense
    pattern. For example, we can set up our MVC or WebAPI server to send out a cookie
    called XSRF-TOKEN. When AngularJS detects that cookie in the response header,
    it creates a custom X-XSRF-TOKEN header with the value of the XSRF-TOKEN cookie.
    The two values are then compared on the server, and if they match, the authorization
    is valid. The attacker cannot trick the browser to send out the custom header
    since it is something AngularJS sends when making legitimate requests from within
    the app.

    \ which are encoded bits of data containing authorization data, information about\
    \ the user, expiration time, and whatever else we choose to put in it. A token\
    \ is not encrypted, but encoded, so we need to be careful not to put sensitive\

  context: Providing the implementation as a second type parameter will lazy-load

    are shared by the entire application and need to be managed. A logger is used
    as a classic example of a singleton. If we only use one log stream, e.g., console,
    all we need is one logger instance for our outputs.
