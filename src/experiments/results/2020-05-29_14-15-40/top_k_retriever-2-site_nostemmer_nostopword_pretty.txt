context             | There are several approaches for integrating custom
                    fonts to standards-compliant web pages - some of them
                    use custom scripts (Cufon, sIFR, FLIR), and others use
                    pure-CSS solutions, like @font-face. All of these
                    technologies have valid arguments both for and against
                    their use, but probably the most flexible and safest,
                    and in general the best method for using various non
                    -system fonts on your web site is @font-face.

                    rules in my previous post. Normally you would have to
                    set the rules up through your source-code, but since
                    this is a one-time set-up, it makes no sense to keep
                    this code in your project. That's why we made a simple
                    web app for managing Azure CORS rules which you can

                    actually show up in the browser (on initial and every
                    subsequent render) and huge amount of watchers will
                    make your website laggy and less responsive in general
                    once everything is rendered. Keep in mind that
                    recommended amount of watchers per page is around
                    2000. So if your list is not that long but 'only' has
                    a lot of watchers, you might be able to work around
                    the problem using bindonce which will significantly
                    decrease the number of watchers on your page. If your
                    list however is quite long, rendering it will take
                    some time.

                    really need all your communication between the client
                    and the server to go through sockets. For all the
                    parts of your application that require real-time
                    communication SocketIO will be perfect but for
                    everything else you might be better off using standard
                    REST API calls. Why? Without going into 'speed' and
                    'ease of implementation' pros and cons (there's plenty
                    of that lying around the Internet) I see a few reasons
                    why one might want to use both in the same
                    application. REST is still a bit more 'standard' way
                    to exchange data and if there is no real need to use
                    websockets everywhere, your team might be a bit more
                    comfortable using REST since it's what they've been
                    using 'ever since'. Other than that, you might be in
                    the middle of a project that previously used REST for
                    everything and now the need arose to develop a
                    component which requires real-time communication. Of
                    course, you won't be rewriting all your code to
                    SocketIO because there are more important things to
                    dedicate your time to. Or you might simply believe
                    SocketIO should be in charge of everything real-time
                    and REST should be used to handle everything else -
                    which is also perfectly fine. Either way, you'll most
                    probably get into situation where you'll want to share
                    session data between the two.

                    on our new visual identity and the new Mono website.
                    Today is the day where we share the results of this
                    work with the rest of the world.  The idea behind the
                    new site is to add new value to our clients, users and
                    the community. Take your time to find out about our
                    new products such as Baasic and Theor.io, or see
                    what's been happening lately with MonoX and eCTD

context             | The best and most recommended option is to hire a pro.
                    If you have a team member who is a semi-pro or an
                    amateur photographer with a good set of lens and a
                    DSLR you can take a walk on the wild side and make
                    your own photos. Professional photographers are
                    already familiar with lightning, they know their
                    camera really well and don't lack in equipment that is
                    too expensive for an amateur. On the other hand,
                    hiring a professional does not guarantee quality of
                    your photo story. Sometimes the story is not very well
                    told by the photographer, sometimes the
                    lightning/colours/tone in the photographs doesn't
                    reflect your brand or product. Those things happen
                    commonly so make sure you communicate your
                    expectations and your brand with the professional down
                    to the detail. Put pros and cons on paper and decide
                    what is best for your project.

context             | While we've used SQL Server in most of our previous
                    implementations, after doing some preliminary tests,
                    PostgreSQL proved to be a very capable relational
                    database. After all, it has millions of
                    implementations over its 30-year history. It is still
                    being kept very relevant in the big data era by adding
                    support for new data types, such as JSON - a feature
                    that is essential for implementing dynamic types and
                    similar functionality in Baasic and similar solutions.
                    The capability to handle schema-less data
                    simultaneously with traditional relational data is a
                    big plus for us. However, as most of traditional
                    RDBMSes designed to power transactional workloads, it
                    cannot scale out horizontally (at least without
                    specialized add-ons). When resources become thin, you
                    would buy a bigger server, instead of scaling the load
                    out to multiple smaller machines. While scale-out
                    approach is becoming increasingly popular these days
                    (mostly in various NoSQL incarnations), I would still
                    argue that scaling up is a viable solution for a large
                    class of problems. If you need to scale on a Google
                    scale, scale out is the right way to go. However, we
                    are not Google, and neither are most of the web sites
                    and applications.

context             | A failover cluster is a group of servers that work
                    together to maintain high availability of applications
                    and services (these are known as roles). If one of the
                    servers (or nodes) fails, another node in the cluster
                    can take over its workload without any downtime. In
                    addition, the clustered roles are monitored to verify
                    that they are working properly. If they are not
                    working, they are restarted or moved to another node.
                    Failover clusters also provide Cluster Shared Volume
                    (CSV, more on that later) functionality that provides
                    a consistent, distributed namespace that clustered
                    roles can use to access shared storage from all nodes.
                    Using this technology, you can scale up to 64 physical
                    nodes and to 8,000 virtual machines.

context             | A failover cluster is a group of servers that work
                    together to maintain high availability of applications
                    and services (these are known as roles). If one of the
                    servers (or nodes) fails, another node in the cluster
                    can take over its workload without any downtime. In
                    addition, the clustered roles are monitored to verify
                    that they are working properly. If they are not
                    working, they are restarted or moved to another node.
                    Failover clusters also provide Cluster Shared Volume
                    (CSV, more on that later) functionality that provides
                    a consistent, distributed namespace that clustered
                    roles can use to access shared storage from all nodes.
                    Using this technology, you can scale up to 64 physical
                    nodes and to 8,000 virtual machines.

context             | Just to briefly mention the rest of the network
                    infrastructure (firewalls, routers and load balancers)
                    in front of these servers. Everything is set up in a
                    redundant fashion. Therefore, firewalls/routers are
                    using Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) that
                    introduce a concept of virtual routers, which are an
                    abstract representation of multiple routers - master
                    and backup - acting as a group. When an active routers
                    fails, a backup router is automatically selected to
                    replace it. In a similar fashion, we are using
                    multiple HAProxy load balancers, along with multiple A
                    DNS records for our service employing round robin
                    technique. There are multiple approaches for achieving
                    the full redundancy and avoiding single point of
                    failure in this type of environment: for example,
                    Stackoverflow apparently uses keepalived to ensure
                    high availability; heartbeat is also an alternative.
                    We opted for an alternative approach that combines DNS
                    load balancing - which achieves a fairly rough balance
                    of traffic between multiple load balancers and enable
                    failover when one of load balancer dies - and using
                    load balancers to do their job on a more granular
                    level. 'DNS Load Balancing and Using Multiple Load
                    Balancers in the Cloud' and 'How To Configure DNS

context             | Is is always a good idea to use at least two separate
                    NICs in failover clustering scenarios: the public
                    interface is configured with the IP address that will
                    be used to communicate with clients over the network,
                    while the private interface is used for communicating
                    with other cluster nodes ('heartbeat'). We will use an
                    additional NIC for backup purposes - although this is
                    not absolutely necessary, it will offload the traffic
                    caused by regular backup tasks from the public
                    interface. This leaves us with one free NIC, and we've
                    decided to team two NICs on a main public interface.
                    NIC team is basically a collection of network
                    interfaces that work together as one, providing
                    bandwidth aggregation and redundancy. It is easy to

                    here is an excellent article on NIC teaming that will

                    Generally speaking, clustering involves using two or
                    more physical servers to create one 'logical' server
                    that exposes some functionality to users or
                    applications. The members of the cluster (called
                    nodes) are able to monitor each other and, if one of
                    them goes down, its functionality 'fails over' to
                    other nodes without causing any disruption of service
                    to the users.

                    needs to be injected by the parent scoping type (Foo

                    various confusing posts, so one may need to dig
                    further to find a coherent answer. I found it nicely
                    explained in this old article - Cache-and-Collect
                    Lifecycle Management in Ninject 2.0. It seems that the
                    only way to have a deterministic dispose of an
                    instance bound to a custom scope is to have that scope
                    implement the Ninject's INotifyWhenDisposed interface.
                    It will immediately cause the disposal of any
                    IDisposable instance associated with the scope object
                    when scope's Dispose method is invoked. The key thing
                    is to raise the INotifyWhenDisposed.Disposed event
                    within the Dispose method. Here's the code for the

                    Similar services are offered by other cloud providers,

                    building fault-tolerant systems that operate with a
                    minimal amount of human interaction and up-front
                    financial investment. We have chosen AWS because of
                    its sheer size, popularity, and price structure. More
                    importantly, we were looking to avoid complicated and
                    time-consuming administrative tasks such as database
                    installation and upgrades; storage management;
                    replication for high availability and read throughput;
                    and backups for disaster recovery. Over the past few
                    years, PostgreSQL has become the preferred open source
                    relational database for many developers, and we are

                    choice for both smaller shops without an experienced

                    be one of the coolest database features we use in the

                    automatically creates a primary DB Instance and
                    synchronously replicates the data to a standby
                    instance in a different Availability Zone. Each AZ has
                    its own physically distinct infrastructure. In the
                    case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs
                    an automatic failover to the standby, so that you can
                    resume database operations as soon as the failover is
                    complete - in our initial tests, this takes less than
                    a minute. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance
                    remains the same after a failover, your application
                    can resume database operation without the need for any
                    manual intervention.

                    Well, Angular 2 can be written in JavaScript,
                    Typescript, and Dart, but sympathy mostly goes to
                    Typescript as it is the language Angular 2 was written
                    in. Although it does eventually compile to plain

                    lets you build things that would otherwise take time
                    and time to do. What you're actually doing with
                    Angular 2 is writing templates in Typescript. Angular
                    2 then turns that templates into code that's highly
                    optimized for today's JavaScript virtual machines,

                    appearance or behavior of an element they are applied
                    to. These directives are specified by their selector
                    using square brackets (read more about attribute
                    directives here).  Structural directives are here to
                    add, remove, and replace elements in DOM. If you used
                    AngularJS, you have seen them or used them plenty of
                    times. Like in AngularJS, ng-if and ng-repeat exist in
                    Angular 2 too, but are slightly changed. Structural
                    directives now start with a '*'(*ngFor, *ngIf). If you
                    see that in an HTML code, that is a structural
                    directive (read more about structural directives

context             | In Angular 2, services are often used to fetch the data
                    from the server. While doing so they use HTTP client
                    that is built in Angular 2. There was a slight twist
                    in how the data can be fetched. Just as AngularJS use
                    promises, Angular 2 uses promises, but wait... Angular
                    2 new favorite way of getting data is via Observables!

                    Reactive Extensions. If you haven't seen them yet,
                    it's time to learn more. But what's the difference
                    between promises and observables? Observables are lazy
                    - meaning you have to subscribe to them in order to
                    trigger their behavior and you can also cancel your

                    million Facebook users and around 11 000 bots already
                    created. Why? Well, computers are good at remembering
                    stuff, automating mundane tasks, and making accurate
                    calculations very fast. And when users prompt your bot
                    for information, the response is imminent; they don't
                    have to wait for someone to read the message first and
                    then look for the information. Of course, there are
                    still skeptics who'd prefer talking to a human as well

                    mechanism, developers would need to manually assign
                    values to model properties, which would result in
                    writing almost the same code in every action method.

context             | AngularJS also provides protection from certain types
                    of attacks if the server is compatible and properly
                    configured. Firstly, for those who do not know,
                    cookies are domain-specific data that persists when
                    making requests. If cookies are being used for
                    authorization between the server and the client,
                    AngularJS provides protection from XSRF attacks by
                    using the double-submit cookie defense pattern. For
                    example, we can set up our MVC or WebAPI server to
                    send out a cookie called XSRF-TOKEN. When AngularJS
                    detects that cookie in the response header, it creates
                    a custom X-XSRF-TOKEN header with the value of the
                    XSRF-TOKEN cookie. The two values are then compared on
                    the server, and if they match, the authorization is
                    valid. The attacker cannot trick the browser to send
                    out the custom header since it is something AngularJS
                    sends when making legitimate requests from within the
                    app.

context             | There are a couple of ways of authorizing communication
                    between client and server. For one, we can use
                    cookies, but there are plenty of ways to exploit them
                    if we’re not careful. The most common way is through
                    the use of tokens, which are encoded bits of data
                    containing authorization data, information about the
                    user, expiration time, and whatever else we choose to
                    put in it. A token is not encrypted, but encoded, so
                    we need to be careful not to put sensitive data (like
                    passwords). We will be looking at an example that uses
                    tokens generated on the server.

context             | Once the services are defined, it is necessary to
                    register the dependencies in ConfigureServices method
                    inside the Startup.cs class, so ASP.NET can know about
                    them. When declaring a service, in ASP.NET Core
                    context, there are three kinds of object lifetimes to
                    choose from: Singleton, Scoped, or Transient. It is
                    important to understand how each of them works, so we
                    know which one to use, in what situations.

context             | Providing the implementation as a second type parameter
                    will lazy-load the service the first time it is
                    requested. Another option, but not a better one, would
                    be to create a specific instance of the concrete
                    implementation ourselves, inside the ConfigureServices
                    method.  Singletons are useful for resources which are
                    shared by the entire application and need to be
                    managed. A logger is used as a classic example of a
                    singleton. If we only use one log stream, e.g.,
                    console, all we need is one logger instance for our
                    outputs.
